# Finding p_dot (the rate of change/velocity of the position vector from Earth to comet):
# at each timestep, the comet's radial veloc (tow Earth) should be ~ project° of p_dot along u.

# First, stacking the unit vectors into a matrix, such that each becomes a column:
U = np.column_stack((u1, u2, u3)) # shape: (N,3)
# u1, u2 and u3 are arrays ([N, 1]) where each value represents a measurement.

# Component of the comet's veloc vect in the same dir as the LOS (Earth to comet direct°):

# veloc_vect_Ear_comet = matrix where each row is a vector w components in the x, y & z directions
# U = matrix where each row is a unit vector from Earth to 3I/ATLAS for some timestep.

# Least Squares formula involves summing along each timestep to get a single scalar value p_dot.
# it works by fitting a slope to a supposedly linear trend between the num and deno:
numerator = np.sum(np.einsum('ij,ij->i', U, veloc_vect_Ear_comet))
